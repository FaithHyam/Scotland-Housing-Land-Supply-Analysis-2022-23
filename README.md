This is a practise of some basic data analysis. It is my first time using Jupyter Notebook, and I chose to have a brief look at housing supply data in Scotland. 

I went on to do a slighlty more detailed analysis after this, in my next repository, where I looked specifically at the number of houses built in Scotland since 1996.
